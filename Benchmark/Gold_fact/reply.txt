 "The sign-off on success for our project is the Product Owner, Rachel Lee. She's the one who ensures that the product meets the business requirements and that the features delivered are aligned with the overall product strategy. If we're adding a new feature, like the AI-powered recommendation engine, Rachel will need to be involved in the decision-making process and will ultimately sign off on its inclusion in the project scope."
